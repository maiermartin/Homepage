I am especially interested in macro and finance, also behavioral finance. Also, I like to work with data and apply econometric analysis. I prefer -R- for data analysis, but I try to get used to Python too. 

I provide an introductory -R- course for economics students at the University of Graz [here](https://maiermartin.github.io/Economics-R-Tutorial/).
